## ðŸš€ What is DataSpatial Explorer?

**DataSpatial Explorer** is a signal simulation and visualization tool where "data objects" behave like real-world devices in space.

Instead of traditional CRUD logic, this app **models behavior based on distance, overlap, and interference**, making it ideal for:

- ðŸ›° Wireless sensor network modeling
- ðŸ“¶ Wi-Fi/IoT signal placement testing
- ðŸ¤– Agent-based systems
- ðŸŽ“ Education in spatial computing or data visualization

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features at a Glance

ðŸ”§ **Interactive Device Setup**
- Add devices with custom IDs, positions, and signal ranges
- Modify existing devices instantly with live feedback

ðŸ“Š **Dynamic Visualization**
- Visual 2D grid powered by Plotly
- Devices and signal radii rendered as interactive nodes
- Connections auto-highlighted by signal logic

ðŸŽ¨ **Color-Coded Signal Logic**
| Status         | Meaning                                       | Color   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Connected    | Signal reaches another device's center        | Green   |
| ðŸŸ¡ Overlapping  | Signals overlap but not fully connected       | Yellow  |
| ðŸ”´ Interfering  | Both signals overlap each other's centers     | Red     |
| âš« Isolated     | Device stands alone, no connections           | Gray    |

ðŸŒ€ **Simulate Movement**
- Devices drift randomly to simulate mobility
- Triggers real-time connection updates

ðŸ“˜ **Live Connection Status**
- Textual log of current connection states below the grid
- Auto-refreshes with every move or edit

---

## ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

- **IoT Planning**: Test ideal sensor placements
- **Mesh Network Design**: Simulate signal spread and loss
- **Emergency Scenarios**: Visualize coverage gaps
- **Teaching Aid**: Explain proximity, distance, and network theory
